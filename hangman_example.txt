insert the manual of the game:
     In hangman, the computer picks a word from the on-line word list and you
     must try to guess it.  The computer keeps track of which letters have
     been guessed and how many wrong guesses you have made on the screen in a
     graphic fashion.

content:what is the goal of the game?
response: The goal of the game Hangman is to guess the word that the computer has picked from the on-line word list by correctly identifying its letters. Players try to avoid making wrong guesses as they are counted, and if too many wrong guesses are made, the player loses by having their character (in this case, a man) hanged on a gallows graphic displayed on the screen.

content:what is the correct format in which the player should insert the action?
response: The correct format in which the player should insert their actions would be to input a single letter or word that they think could be part of the hidden word. For example, if the computer showed the word "CAT" with blanks, and the player thought the first letter was 'C', they would input "c".

content:describe the format of valid actions synthetically 
response: In Hangman, valid actions are single letters or words that the player believes are part of the hidden word. These actions should be entered one at a time as players try to guess the complete word without making too many wrong guesses. If the letter or word is correct and present in the hidden word, it will be revealed; if it's incorrect or not in the word, a wrong guess will be counted and the game may proceed with displaying more gallows graphics if necessary.

content:is there an explicit score in this game? if not, how do you detect progress?
response: There is no explicit score in Hangman, but players can track their progress by the number of blanks that are filled in and remaining guesses. Players also have a visual cue with the gallows graphic, which represents their progress towards losing the game - the more wrong guesses they make, the further along the gallows graphic they see on screen.

content:how do you progress in this game?
response: In Hangman, you progress by correctly guessing letters of the hidden word to fill in the blanks. As more blanks are filled, you get closer to discovering the whole word. However, you must be cautious not to make too many wrong guesses, as this will lead to a hanged man in the graphic and eventually result in your loss.

content:what should a player avoid in this game?
response: In Hangman, players should avoid making wrong guesses because each wrong guess counts against them and can eventually lead to their character being hanged on the gallows graphic. To avoid this, the player should try to deduce the word by thinking of common words or patterns based on previously revealed letters.

content:is it possible to win the game? how?
response: Yes, it is possible to win the game of Hangman by correctly guessing all the letters in the hidden word before running out of remaining guesses or without allowing the gallows graphic to be fully displayed. To do this, players should try to deduce the word using their knowledge of common words and patterns based on previously revealed letters.

content:is it possible to lose the game? how?
response: Yes, it is possible to lose the game of Hangman by either running out of remaining guesses or having the gallows graphic become fully displayed. This will result in the player's character being hanged on screen. To prevent this, players should carefully consider the letters they guess and try to deduce the word using their knowledge of common words and patterns based on previously revealed letters.

content:based on your previous answers, list all the information that are useful to succesfully play the game

content:based on the information you received, what are the valid action a player can take in this state?
response: In your current state of the game, as mentioned earlier, you can input a single letter or word that you think could be part of the hidden word. For instance, if you think the first letter is 'C', you would input "c" as an action to proceed in the game. Remember to keep track of your progress by observing how many blanks are filled and remaining guesses, and try to deduce the word using knowledge of common words and patterns based on previously revealed letters.
content:based on the information you received and your previous answer, what is the best action a player can take in this state?
response: The best action for the player in your current state of the game would be to input an educated guess based on common words and patterns. Since no letters have been revealed, you could start by trying a letter that is commonly found in many words, such as 'E' or 'A'. This will maximize the chances of having a correct guess and moving forward in the game while minimizing the risk of losing.
content:list some examples of valid action, in the correct format
response: Some examples of valid actions in the correct format would be:
1. "c" - If you believe the first letter of the hidden word is 'C'.
2. "cat" - If you deduce that the hidden word is a common word such as "cat".
3. "e" - If you think the second letter of the hidden word is 'E', and you have not yet guessed any letters in that position.
4. "a_" - If you believe the first two letters are 'A' and you want to maintain the blank for the third letter.
content:pick an action from the ones you listed in your previous answer
response: Based on the information given, it's difficult to recommend a specific action without knowing the current state of the game or any hints provided. However, a good starting action could be: "e". This is because 'E' is one of the most common letters in English words and it can help increase your chances of guessing correctly in this early stage of the game.

response: Some examples of valid actions in the correct format would be:
1. "t" - If you believe the next letter is 'T' after having guessed 'e' and 'a'.
2. "_r_" - If you think there might be a blank before the next letter and it could be 'R', for example.
3. "o" - If you deduce that the hidden word has the letters "ea" in that specific position, such as "eat".

len global prompt: 2
content:what is the goal of the game?
response: The goal of the game Hangman is to guess the correct word by using the given clues or by correctly guessing the individual letters. If you successfully guess all the letters before running out of guesses, you win. But if you make too many incorrect guesses, the computer will "draw" a hanging man, thus resulting in your loss.

len global prompt: 4
content:what is the correct format in which the player should insert the action?
response: In hangman, you would typically input a letter to guess if you are trying to figure out a specific letter. For example: "a". The game will then either reveal that letter if it is in the word or not, depending on your guess.

len global prompt: 6
content:describe the format of valid actions synthetically
response: In hangman, valid actions are single letters that you wish to guess or try to find in the mystery word. The format is simply entering a letter, for example: "a". No special characters or spaces are needed.
len global prompt: 8
content:is there an explicit score in this game? if not, how do you detect progress?
response: There isn't a specific numerical score in hangman. Progress is detected by the number of correct guesses made and wrong guesses that remain before the player loses. The game continues until either the word is fully revealed or all attempts have been exhausted. If you manage to guess the entire word, it can be considered a win for the player.
len global prompt: 10
content:how do you progress in this game?
response: To progress in hangman, you need to guess the correct letters of the mystery word. The computer will show the letters you have correctly guessed and keep track of your wrong guesses. As you make more correct guesses or deduce the whole word eventually, the game continues until either all letters are revealed or there are no more chances left for guessing. So, you progress by accurately identifying the letters in the word through your educated guesses and the clues provided by the game.
len global prompt: 12
content:what should a player avoid in this game?
response: In hangman, a player should avoid making too many incorrect guesses or assumptions because each wrong guess counts against the total number of allowed wrong guesses. If all guesses are used up and the word is not fully guessed, the game is lost. So, it's best to carefully try to identify or eliminate potential letters logically.
len global prompt: 14
content:is it possible to win the game? how?
response: Yes, it is possible to win hangman. To win, you need to correctly guess all the letters in the mystery word before you run out of wrong guesses or attempts. If you manage to do that, you have successfully identified the whole word and won the game.
len global prompt: 16
content:is it possible to lose the game? how?
response: Yes, it is possible to lose hangman. You will lose if you make too many wrong guesses, and there are no more chances left for guessing. If all your attempts have been used up and the word is not fully guessed, the game is lost.
len global prompt: 18
content:based on your previous answers, list all the information that are useful to succesfully play the game

len global prompt: 2
len global prompt: 4
content:based on the information you received, what are the valid action a player can take in this state?
response: In this state of the game, the valid action for the player would be to input a single letter to guess as the remaining unidentified letter in the word "porta les". The player should carefully consider their options and make an educated guess. For example, if they think "l" could be the next letter, they would input "l". The game will then reveal whether this letter is correct or not, moving them closer to completing the word.
len global prompt: 6
content:based on the information you received and your previous answer, what is the best action a player can take in this state?
response: Based on the provided context and assuming that all possible letters have been guessed except for the one remaining, it would be challenging to determine the exact best action without more information. However, considering the given word "porta les," we can attempt to use our knowledge of common words and patterns in language to make an educated guess.

For example, since there are no repeated letters in the already guessed part of the word, we could assume that the remaining letter is not a repetition of any other previously guessed letter, narrowing down potential options. Additionally, knowing that "porta" means "door" in French might give an indication that the next letter could be an "s." So, in this scenario, a possible best action would be to input the letter "s". But it is important to remember that this is just a guess based on available information, and there may still be other valid possibilities.
len global prompt: 8
content:list some examples of valid action, in the correct format
response: Some possible valid actions, assuming all guessed letters have been taken into account:
1. Guess "s" as a potential next letter.
2. Guess "t" as a potential next letter, as "les" is a common ending in French.
3. Analyze the context and word patterns (such as the fact that "porta" means "door") to make an educated guess. For example, if we know that words often end with an "s," it would be reasonable to try guessing "s".
4. Use knowledge of other languages or dictionaries to search for potential words related to "porta les."
5. Consider the remaining letters in the word and see if there are any repeating patterns, which could provide clues on the next letter.
len global prompt: 10
content:pick an action from the ones you listed in your previous answer
response: Taking into consideration the information we have about the word "porta les" and the provided options, one example of a valid action could be:

Guessing "s" as the remaining unidentified letter in the word. This is because "les" is a common ending in French words, and the addition of an "s" to "porta" would form the complete word "portas," meaning "doors."
